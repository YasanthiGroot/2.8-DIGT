    Equipment needed:
    <br>
    2x dumbbells
    <br>
    <br>
    Muscles worked:
    <br>
    Quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, calves
    <br>
    <br>
    Instructions
    <br>
    1. Begin by standing up straight with your feet hip-width apart.
    <br>
    2. Take a step forward with your right foot, ensuring that your stride is long enough to create a 90-degree angle with your right knee when it's bent. Your left knee should be hovering just above the ground.
    <br>
    3. Lower your body down by bending both knees. Your right thigh should be parallel to the ground, and your left knee should come close to touching the ground without actually touching it.
    <br>
    4. Maintain an upright posture throughout the movement. Your torso should remain straight, and your chest should be lifted. Avoid leaning forward.
    <br>
    5. Push off the ground with your right foot, using your right heel to return to the starting position.
    <br>
    6. As you return to the starting position, instead of bringing your right foot back next to your left foot, step forward with your left foot into the lunge position.
    <br>
    7. Continue this alternating walking lunge pattern for your desired number of repetitions or distance.
    <br>
    <br>
    Walking lunges offer a range of benefits for your overall fitness and lower body strength. Here are some of the key advantages of incorporating walking lunges into 
    your exercise routine:
    <br>
    <br>
    Lower Body Strength: Walking lunges primarily target the muscles in your lower body, including your quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes (buttocks), and calves. This
    exercise helps to strengthen these muscle groups, promoting better overall leg and lower body strength. Functional Movement: Walking lunges simulate a natural 
    walking motion while adding resistance, making them a functional exercise. This can improve your ability to perform daily activities that involve walking, 
    stepping, and maintaining balance. Muscle Imbalance Correction: Many people have muscle imbalances due to various factors, such as posture and lifestyle habits.
    Walking lunges can help address these imbalances by targeting each leg individually, promoting more balanced strength development. Core Engagement: To maintain 
    proper form during walking lunges, you need to engage your core muscles for stability. This adds an element of core training to the exercise, helping to improve
    core strength and stability. Hip Flexor Flexibility: as you step forward and lower into the lunge position, your hip flexors are stretched. Regularly performing
    walking lunges can help improve hip flexor flexibility and range of motion.
    <br>
    <br>
    Incorporating walking lunges into your fitness routine can lead to improved lower body strength, better functional movement, and a range of other physical 
    benefits. Remember to always maintain proper form and gradually increase the intensity as your strength and fitness level improve.
