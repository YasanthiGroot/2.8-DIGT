<strong>
    Equipment Needed:
    <br>
    2x Dumbell
    <br>
    <br>
    Muscles Worked:
    <br>
    Biceps
    <br>
    <br>
    Instructions:
    <br>
    1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart.
    <br>
    2. Hold a dumbell in each hand, palms facing forward, and 
    let your arms hang down by your sides. Your elbows should be 
    close to your body.
    <br>
    3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly bend your elbows
    to lift the dumbbells towards your shoulders.
    <br>
    4. Once the dumbbells are close to your shoulders, pause for a brief
    moment and feel the contraction in your biceps.
    <br>
    5. In a controlled manner, lower the dumbbells back to the starting
    position.
    <br>
    6. Repeat the curling movement for the desired number of repetitions.
    Start with a manageable number of reps, such as 8-12.
    <br>

    Bicep curls are a popular strength training exercise that primarily targets the biceps, the muscles located on the front of your upper arms. This simple yet 
    effective exercise offers several benefits for your overall fitness and upper body strength. Here are some of the key benefits of bicep curls:
    <br>
    <br>
    Increased Bicep Strength: Bicep curls directly target the biceps, helping to build and strengthen these muscles. As you progressively increase the resistance 
    or weight used in the exercise, your biceps adapt and grow stronger over time.Improved Arm Definition: Regularly performing bicep curls can lead to more defined  
    and toned arms. As the biceps develop, they become more visible and contribute to a more sculpted appearance in the upper arm region.Functional Strength for Daily
    Activities: Strong biceps are essential for performing various daily tasks that involve lifting, pulling, and carrying objects. Improving bicep strength through 
    curls can make these activities easier and more manageable.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's important to note that while bicep curls have numerous benefits, they are just one component of a well-rounded strength training program. To achieve overall 
    upper body strength and balanced muscle development, it's essential to include a variety of exercises that target different muscle groups. Additionally,
     practising proper form and using appropriate weights are crucial to avoid injuries and maximise the benefits of bicep curls. As with any exercise, consulting
      with a fitness professional or trainer can be helpful in creating a personalised workout plan that aligns with your fitness goals and abilities.
