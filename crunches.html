    Equipment needed:
    <br>
    Mat or comfortable surface
    <br>
    <br>
    Muscles worked:
    <br>
    Core
    <br>
    <br>
    Instructions:
    <br>
    1. Lie down on your back on a mat or a comfortable surface.
    <br>
    2. Bend your knees and place your feet flat on the ground, hip-width apart.
    <br>
    3. Keep your hands lightly touching your temples, fingers gently supporting your head. 
    <br>
    4. Gently lift your head, neck, and shoulders off the ground by contracting your abdominal muscles. 
    <br>
    5. Keep your lower back on the ground throughout the movement. Your lower back should not lift off the mat.
    <br>
    6. Focus on using your abdominal muscles to lift, rather than using your hands to pull your head forward.
    <br>
    7. Slowly lower your upper body back down to the starting position, using controlled movement.

    Crunches are a popular abdominal exercise that can offer several benefits when performed correctly as part of a balanced fitness routine. Here are some of the key
     benefits of incorporating crunches into your exercise regimen:
    <br>
    <br>
    Core Strength: Crunches primarily target the rectus abdominis muscle, which is the front portion of your abdominal muscles. Regularly performing crunches helps to 
    strengthen this muscle, contributing to improved core strength and stability. Muscle Definition: As you strengthen your rectus abdominis muscles through crunches, 
    you can enhance muscle definition in the abdominal area. While genetics and overall body composition also play a role, strong abdominal muscles can lead to a more 
    toned appearance. Functional Benefits: A strong core is essential for maintaining proper posture and supporting your spine during various movements and activities.
    Strengthening your abdominal muscles with crunches can contribute to better posture and reduce the risk of lower back discomfort. Improved Athletic Performance: 
    Many sports and physical activities involve movements that require core strength, stability, and controlled abdominal contractions. Enhancing your core through 
    exercises like crunches can improve your performance in activities like running, swimming, lifting, and more. Flexibility and Range of Motion: Crunches involve a
    controlled contraction of your abdominal muscles, which can contribute to improved flexibility and range of motion in your core area. This can translate to 
    better movement patterns in daily life.
    <br>
    <br>
    It's important to note that while crunches offer benefits, they should be performed correctly to avoid strain on the neck or lower back. Always prioritise proper 
    form and consider incorporating a variety of core exercises to ensure balanced strength and prevent overuse injuries. If you have any existing health conditions
    or concerns, it's advisable to consult a fitness professional or healthcare provider before starting a new exercise program.
