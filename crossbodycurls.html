     Equipment needed:
     <br>
     2x dumbbells
     <br>
     <br>
     Muscles worked:
     <br>
     Biceps, brachialis, forearms
     <br>
     <br>
     Instructions:
     <br>
     1. Stand up straight with your feet shoulder-width apart.
     <br>
     2. Hold a dumbbell in each hand, palms facing your body, and let your arms hang down by your sides. Your elbows should be close to your body.
     <br>
     3. Keeping your upper arms stationary, slowly bend your elbows to lift the dumbbells towards your shoulders.
     <br>
     4. Once the dumbbells are close to your shoulders, pause for a brief moment and feel the contraction in your biceps and forearms.
     <br>
     5. In a controlled manner, lower the dumbbells back to the starting position, keeping your palms facing your body throughout the movement.
     <br>
     6. Repeat the curling movement for the desired number of repetitions.

     Cross-body curls, also known as hammer curls or cross hammer curls, offer a range of benefits for your upper body strength and overall fitness. This variation of
     traditional bicep curls targets not only the biceps but also the brachialis and brachioradialis muscles in the forearms. Here are some of the key benefits of 
     cross-body curls:
     <br>
     <br>
     Biceps and Forearm Strength: Cross-body curls engage both the biceps and the forearm muscles, including the brachialis and brachioradialis. This dual muscle 
     engagement leads to improved overall upper body strength. Muscle Balance and Symmetry: Including crossbody curls in your workout routine helps promote muscle 
     balance and symmetry in the upper arms. The exercise targets different muscle groups than traditional bicep curls, ensuring a well-rounded and proportional 
     development of the upper arm muscles. Functional Strength for Daily Activities: Strong biceps and forearm muscles are essential for various daily activities that
     involve lifting, carrying, and gripping objects. Crossbody curls help develop functional strength that translates into improved performance in daily tasks.
     Wrist Stability and Flexibility: As you perform crossbody curls, your wrists are engaged to maintain a stable grip on the dumbbells. This can lead to increased
     wrist stability and flexibility, which is beneficial for various activities and exercises.
     <br>
     <br>
     As with any exercise, proper form and technique are essential to maximise the benefits of crossbody curls and prevent injury. It's crucial to start with an 
     appropriate weight and gradually increase resistance as your strength improves. Including crossbody curls as part of a well-rounded strength training program 
     can contribute to a balanced upper body, improved functional strength, and enhanced overall fitness.
