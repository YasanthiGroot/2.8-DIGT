        3. Your arms should be fully extended, and your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.
        <br>
        4. Keep your core engaged and maintain a straight line from head to heels throughout the entire movement.
        <br>
        5. Bend your elbows and lower your chest towards the floor, maintaining a controlled descent.

        Push-ups offer a wide range of benefits for your overall fitness and are considered one of the most effective bodyweight exercises. They primarily target 
        the chest, shoulders, triceps, and core muscles. Here are some of the key benefits of doing push-ups:
        <br>
        <br>
        Upper Body Strength: Push-ups are a compound exercise that engage multiple muscle groups in the upper body. They help build and strengthen the muscles of 
        the chest, shoulders, and arms, including the pectoralis major, deltoids, and triceps. Core Stability: Performing push-ups requires maintaining a straight
        body position from head to heels. This engages the core muscles, including the rectus abdominis and obliques, to stabilise the body throughout the movement.
        Improved Functional Fitness: Push-ups mimic movements used in various daily activities, such as pushing open a door or lifting objects from the ground.
        Strengthening these pushing muscles through push-ups can enhance your functional fitness and make daily tasks easier. Increased Upper Body Endurance:
        Regularly incorporating push-ups into your workout routine can improve upper body endurance. As you progress and perform more repetitions, your muscles
        become more resistant to fatigue. Flexibility and Range of Motion: Performing push-ups through a full range of motion can enhance flexibility in the
        shoulder and chest muscles. This can help prevent tightness and improve overall shoulder mobility.
        <br>
        <br>
        As with any exercise, proper form and technique are crucial to maximise the benefits of push-ups and prevent injury. Focus on maintaining a straight body
        line and controlling your movements throughout the exercise. Additionally, combining push-ups with other strength training exercises and a well-rounded
        fitness routine can lead to further fitness gains and overall health improvements.
