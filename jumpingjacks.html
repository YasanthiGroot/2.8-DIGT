    <br>

    <br>
    4. As you jump, your arms move from your sides to overhead.

    Jumping jacks are a simple yet effective exercise that offers a variety of benefits for your cardiovascular health, overall fitness, and even mood. Here are some 
    of the key advantages of including jumping jacks in your workout routine:
    <br>
    <br>
    Cardiovascular Fitness: Jumping jacks are a dynamic and rhythmic exercise that elevates your heart rate. Engaging in this type of cardiovascular activity
    strengthens your heart, improves blood circulation, and enhances your overall cardiovascular fitness. Calorie Burning and Weight Management: Jumping jacks are a 
    high-intensity exercise that burns calories at a relatively rapid rate. Incorporating them into your routine can contribute to weight management and fat loss
    when combined with a balanced diet. Full-Body Engagement: Jumping jacks engage multiple muscle groups simultaneously. The motion works your legs, hips, core, 
    shoulders, and arms, making it a comprehensive full-body exercise. Bone Health:The impact of jumping during jumping jacks can stimulate bone growth and help 
    maintain bone density. Weight-bearing exercises like jumping jacks are beneficial for bone health, reducing the risk of conditions like osteoporosis. Improved 
    Coordination and Balance: The rhythmic nature of jumping jacks requires coordination between your upper and lower body. Regular practice can help improve your 
    coordination and balance, enhancing your overall body control.
    <br>
    <br>
    Remember to start gradually if you're new to jumping jacks or have any existing health concerns. Always prioritise proper form and safety, and consider consulting 
    a healthcare professional before starting a new exercise program, especially if you have any medical conditions.
