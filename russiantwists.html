    Russian twists are a popular core-strengthening exercise that offers several benefits when incorporated into your fitness routine. Here are some of the key 
    advantages of doing Russian twists:
    <br>
    <br>
    Core Strength: Russian twists primarily target your core muscles, including the rectus abdominis (front of the abdomen) and the obliques (side of the abdomen). 
    Regularly performing this exercise helps to strengthen these muscles, leading to improved core stability and overall strength. Oblique Engagement: The twisting
    motion of Russian twists specifically engages the oblique muscles, which are responsible for rotating and stabilising the torso. Strong obliques contribute to 
    better posture, spinal alignment, and rotational movements. Functional Movement: Russian twists mimic twisting motions often used in daily activities and sports.
    Strengthening your oblique muscles through this exercise can enhance your ability to perform movements like reaching, bending, and twisting with greater control 
    and stability. Improved Athletic Performance: Strong core muscles are essential for many athletic activities, such as running, cycling, golfing, and tennis.
    Engaging in exercises like Russian twists can lead to enhanced athletic performance by providing better core stability and power transfer. Balance and 
    Coordination: Russian twists require balance and coordination as you rotate your torso while keeping your lower body stable. This can contribute to improved 
    overall balance and coordination in various activities.
    <br>
    <br>
    Incorporate Russian twists into a well-rounded core-strengthening routine alongside other exercises targeting different areas of the core. As with any exercise, 
    focus on proper form and start with an appropriate level of intensity based on your fitness level.
