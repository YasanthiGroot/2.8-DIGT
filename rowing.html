    Equipment needed:
    <br>
    Rowing machine
    <br>
    <br>
    Muscles worked:
    <br>
    Full body, cardiovascular strength
    <br>
    <br>
    Instructions:
    <br>
    1. Adjust the foot straps: sit on the seat and place your feet on the footrests. Strap your feet in securely to prevent them from slipping during the rowing motion.
    <br>
    2. Grab the handle with both hands, palms facing down. Your hands should be slightly wider than shoulder width apart.
    <br>
    3. Sit on the seat and slide your feet back until your legs are fully extended.
    <br>
    4. Lean slightly forward from your hips while keeping your back straight. Your arms should be fully extended in front of you, and your knees should be bent.
    <br>
    5. Initiate the movement by pushing off with your legs. Simultaneously, lean back slightly from your hips.
    <br>
    6. Slide your seat forward while keeping your arms extended. Your body should be in a slightly forward-leaning position.
    <br>
    7. Once your legs are fully extended, engage your core and lean back slightly further.
    <br>
    8. Pull the handle towards your lower ribs by bending your elbows and drawing them back past your torso. Focus on using your back muscles, not just your arms.
    <br>
    9. When you've pulled the handle towards your lower ribs, your torso should be leaning back at about an 80-degree angle from the ground.
    <br>
    10. To return to the starting position, reverse the sequence: extend your arms, then hinge forward at the hips, and finally bend your knees to slide your seat forward.
    <br>

    Using a rowing machine offers a wide range of benefits, making it a popular choice for both cardiovascular and strength training workouts. Here are some of the key advantages of incorporating a rowing machine into your fitness routine:
    <br>
    <br>
    Full-Body Workout: Rowing engages multiple major muscle groups, including the legs, back, core, arms, and shoulders. This leads to a comprehensive full-body
    workout that helps strengthen and tone various muscle groups simultaneously. Cardiovascular Fitness: Rowing is an excellent cardiovascular exercise that elevates
    your heart rate and helps improve your cardiovascular fitness. It can enhance your lung capacity and endurance, making it a great option for improving overall 
    cardiovascular health. Low Impact: Rowing is a low-impact exercise, meaning it puts less stress on the joints compared to activities like running or jumping. This makes it suitable for individuals with joint issues or those who want to minimise impact on their joints. Joint Mobility and Flexibility: The rowing motion involves a fluid movement that requires a good range of motion in the joints. Regular rowing can contribute to better joint mobility and flexibility, particularly in the hips and shoulders. Calorie Burning and Weight Management: Rowing is an efficient calorie-burning exercise. It can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight by burning a significant number of calories during a workout.
    <br>
    <br>
    Incorporating rowing into your fitness routine can lead to improved overall strength, cardiovascular fitness, and overall well-being. As with any exercise, 
    proper form is essential to prevent injury. If you're new to rowing, consider seeking guidance from a fitness professional to ensure you're using the correct
    technique.
