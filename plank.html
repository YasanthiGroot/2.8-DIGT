    Muscles worked:
    <br>
    Rectus abdominis, obliques, and transverse abdominis
    <br>
    <br>
    Instructions:
    <br>
    1. Begin by positioning yourself face down on the floor, resting on your forearms and toes.
    <br>
    2.  Place your elbows directly under your shoulders and keep your forearms parallel to each other.
    <br>
    3. Your arms should be fully extended, and your body should form a straight line from your head to your heels.
    <br>
    4. Engage your core muscles and avoid arching or sagging your back.
    <br>
    5. Hold the plank position by maintaining a straight line from head to heels.
    <br>
    6. Keep your neck in a neutral position by looking at the floor, and avoid tucking your chin or looking up.
    <br>
    7. Start by holding the plank for as long as you can while maintaining proper form.
    <br>
    <br>
    The plank exercise offers a wide range of benefits for your overall fitness and is highly regarded as one of the best 
    core-strengthening exercises. Beyond targeting the core muscles, planks engage various muscle groups throughout the body. 
    Here are some of the key benefits of doing plank exercises: 
    <br>
    <br>
    Core Strength: Planks primarily target the core muscles, including the rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, and
    lower back. Regularly performing planks helps build and strengthen these muscles, leading to improved core stability and 
    strength. Improved Posture: Strong core muscles from plank exercises contribute to better posture by supporting the spine and
    promoting alignment. As you develop better posture, you may experience reduced strain on the neck, shoulders, and lower back. 
    Full-Body Workout: Planks engage not only the core muscles but also the muscles in the shoulders, arms, and glutes. It is a
    compound exercise that targets multiple muscle groups, making it an efficient full-body workout. Enhanced Balance and 
    Stability: Planks require maintaining a stable body position, which helps improve balance and coordination. Strengthening the
    core and stabiliser muscles can enhance overall body stability. Injury Prevention: A strong core plays a crucial role in
    protecting the spine and supporting the body during various physical activities, reducing the risk of injuries, especially
    in the lower back. Increased Flexibility: Planks engage the posterior muscle chain, which includes muscles in the
    shoulders, hamstrings, and arches of the feet. Regular plank exercises can contribute to increased flexibility in these 
    areas.
    <br>
    <br>
    As with any exercise, maintaining proper form during plank exercises is essential to maximise the benefits and prevent injury. 
    Gradually increasing the duration and intensity of your plank holds as your strength improves can help you continuously challenge
    your core muscles and achieve greater fitness gains.
