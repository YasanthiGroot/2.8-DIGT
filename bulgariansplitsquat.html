     Bulgarian split squats offer numerous benefits for lower body strength, stability, and overall fitness. This challenging exercise targets multiple muscle groups
     and can be an excellent addition to your workout routine. Here are some of the key benefits of Bulgarian split squats:
     <br>
     <br>
     Quadriceps Development: Bulgarian split squats heavily target the quadriceps muscles at the front of your thighs. The exercise can help build and strengthen 
     these muscles, leading to improved lower body strength. Glute Activation: While primarily a quadriceps exercise, Bulgarian split squats also engage the gluteal 
     muscles (glutes). Proper form and an extended range of motion can activate the glutes, contributing to a well-rounded lower body workout. Hamstring Engagement: 
     As you lower your body in the split squat motion, the hamstrings at the back of your thighs are engaged to stabilise and support the movement. Improved Balance 
     and Stability: Performing Bulgarian split squats on one leg requires balance and stability. This unilateral exercise helps address any strength imbalances
     between your legs and enhances overall stability. Core Activation: Your core muscles are engaged to maintain stability and balance during the exercise. This 
     added core engagement contributes to improved core strength.
     <br>
     <br>
     As with any exercise, proper form is essential to maximise the benefits and reduce the risk of injury. Start with bodyweight only if you're new to this exercise, 
     and gradually increase resistance as you become more comfortable and stronger. If you have any pre-existing conditions or concerns, consider consulting a fitness
     professional before adding Bulgarian split squats to your routine.
