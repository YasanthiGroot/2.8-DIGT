    <strong>
    Equipment needed:
    <br>
    1x dumbbell
    <br>
    <br>
    Muscles worked:
    <br>
    Quadriceps, hamstrings, adductor, gluteus maximus, hip flexors, calves
    <br>
    <br>
    Instructions:
    <br>
    1. Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, holding the weight with both hands in front of you.
    <br>
    2. Hold the weight securely against your chest with both hands, keeping your elbows pointing downward.
    <br>
    3. Begin the squat by pushing your hips back and bending your knees. 
    <br>
    4. Keep your chest up and your back straight. Your weight should be distributed evenly through your feet.
    <br>
    5. Lower your body towards the ground while maintaining a neutral spine. Your knees should track inline with your toes.
    <br>
    6. Aim to lower yourself until your thighs are at least parallel to the ground. Your hip crease should be at or slightly below knee level.
    <br>
    7. Push through your heels to initiate the upward phase of the squat. As you do this, straighten your legs and return to the starting position.
    <br>
    <br>
    Squats are a fundamental and compound exercise that offer a wide range of benefits for your overall fitness and strength. They engage multiple muscle groups and
     can be customised to suit different fitness levels and goals. Here are some of the key benefits of incorporating squats into your workout routine:
    <br>
    <br>
    Leg Strength: Squats are renowned for building lower body strength. They primarily target the quadriceps (front thigh muscles), hamstrings (back thigh muscles), 
    and glutes (butt muscles), contributing to enhanced leg power and overall strength. Muscle Building: Squats are a compound movement, meaning they work multiple
    muscle groups simultaneously. This can lead to muscle growth and hypertrophy in the lower body, creating a more toned and sculpted appearance. Functional Movement: 
    Squats mimic movements you perform in daily life, such as bending down, picking up objects, and standing up. Strengthening these movement patterns can improve your 
    overall mobility and make everyday activities easier. Core Engagement: Maintaining proper squat form requires core stabilisation. The core muscles work to keep your 
    torso upright and maintain spinal alignment during the movement. Joint Flexibility: Squatting through a full range of motion promotes joint flexibility in the hips, 
    knees, and ankles. This can help prevent stiffness and improve your ability to move comfortably.
    <br>
    <br>
    Whether you're aiming to build strength, improve overall fitness, or enhance athletic performance, squats can be a valuable addition to your workout routine.
    However, it's important to prioritise proper form to prevent injuries. If you're new to squats, consider seeking guidance from a fitness professional to ensure
    you're performing them correctly.
