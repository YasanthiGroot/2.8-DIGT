    Equipment needed:
    <br>
    2x dumbbell, elevated surface (roughly knee height)
    <br>
    <br>
    Muscles worked:
    <br>
    Quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes
    <br>
    <br>
    Instruction:
    <br>
    1. Hold a dumbbell in each hand by your sides. Keep your arms relaxed with a neutral grip (palms facing your body).
    <br>
    2. Stand facing the bench or step.
    <br>
    3. Place one foot firmly on the bench or step. Your entire foot should be on the surface.
    <br>
    4. Push through your heel as you lift your body up onto the step. Straighten your standing leg fully.
    <br>
    5. Bring your other foot up to join the first one on the bench or step.
    <br>
    6. Stand tall on the step, ensuring both feet are parallel and shoulder-width apart.
    <br>
    7. Begin to step down by leading with the same foot you used to step up.
    <br>
    8. Lower your body back to the starting position with control and stability.
    <br>
    9. Complete the desired number of repetitions on one leg before switching to the other leg.

    Step-ups are a versatile lower body exercise that can offer a range of benefits for your fitness and overall well-being. Whether you're aiming to build strength,
    improve cardiovascular endurance, or enhance functional fitness, incorporating step-ups into your workout routine can be highly effective. Here are some of the
    key benefits of doing step-ups:
    <br>
    <br>
    Leg Strength: Step-ups primarily target the muscles in your lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. Regularly performing step-ups 
    can help increase muscle strength and power in these areas. Muscle Endurance: Step-ups involve repetitive movements using your body weight or added weights. This 
    can lead to improved muscle endurance in the legs, allowing you to perform daily activities more easily and with less fatigue. Functional Movement: Step-ups 
    simulate movements you perform in daily life, such as climbing stairs or stepping onto curbs. Enhancing these movement patterns through exercise can improve your 
    overall mobility and make everyday activities easier. Balance and Coordination: Step-ups challenge your balance and coordination, especially when using weights or
    performing more complex variations. This can enhance your ability to control your body and prevent falls. Cardiovascular Endurance: Performing step-ups at a
    moderate to high intensity can elevate your heart rate, providing a cardiovascular workout. This can contribute to improved cardiovascular fitness and overall 
    endurance. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Whether you're a beginner or an experienced exerciser, step-ups can provide a valuable addition to your fitness routine. Remember to focus on proper form, start 
    with an appropriate step height and weight, and gradually progress as your strength improves. If you have any health concerns or limitations, consider consulting 
    a fitness professional before starting a new exercise routine.
